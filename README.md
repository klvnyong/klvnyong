### Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Kelvin Yong** and I am a Full Stack Developer with over 10 years of experience. I am also the Founder and Chief Technology Officer of [**HEXA Singapore**](https://made.byi3.com/); where we build websites and applications from strategy and planning to design and development.

I mainly work with WordPress and the technology stacks behind it. Currently, I am spending most of my time working on [**WPCache.org**](https://wpcache.org/); an Enterprise Redisâ„¢ Object Cache for WordPress, made for everyone.
